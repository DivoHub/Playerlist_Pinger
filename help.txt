Overview
-----------------------------
This is a console application made in Python used to track and log data on names of players who join and leave any
given server (as specified in config file)

This application works by scraping playerlists from 3 different websites:

1. https://minecraftlist.com/
2. https://minecraft-statistic.net/
3. https://mcsrvstat.us/

By default, the application will request data from "https://minecraftlist.com/"
depending on downtime or website errors. You may have to use the other 2 websites by turning on the alternative checker
This is done by typing "alt" on the application command line.
since "https://minecraft-statistic.net/" does not format their urls coherently in relation to the server ip
you can provide an alternative link by typing "addalt"
if no alt link is specified, the application will then go to the third option
which is "https://mcsrvstat.us/"
